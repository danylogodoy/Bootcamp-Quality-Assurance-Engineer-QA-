## Conclusion
The TripleTen bootcamp challenges us to learn satisfactorily during the learning journey. During my studies, I developed fundamental skills in test analysis, not only testing skills but also communication and critical thinking skills. Throughout the sprints, I was challenged with activities proposed to consolidate content, and in addition to the activities, I worked on TripleTen's own projects as a practical task where three web applications were tested:
- ##### Urban Routes:
A web transportation application that creates and calculates routes and their time and cost based on different means of transportation. Different types of black bag tests were performed on this application.

- ##### Urban Grocers:
A web application for home food delivery, which has different functionalities for both delivery people and customers. API tests were performed.

- ##### Urban Scooter:
A web application for scooter rental with functionalities for customers and delivery people. Functionality tests and API tests of the application were performed.

## Final Conclusion:

##### By completing this course, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of Quality Assurance (QA) and developed essential practical skills. I have learned how to design and execute effective tests, create detailed documentation, perform testing on web applications and APIs, and manipulate databases using SQL. With this solid foundation, I am prepared to take on real-world challenges in the QA field, applying best practices to ensure the quality and efficiency of software products.
